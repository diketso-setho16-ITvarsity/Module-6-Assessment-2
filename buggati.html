                A Bigatti Chiron at 1,497 hp can go faster than 420 kmh (260.9 mph) but is limited to that speed because there are no tires that can go fast enough. Anyway, it can speed up to 100 kmh in 2.4 seconds, 200 kmh in 6.5 seconds, 300 kmh in 13.6 seconds, and finally 400 kmh in 32.6 seconds. Although this car is an amazing invention, 
                it is not affordable to most people because it is US dollars 2,700,000.
